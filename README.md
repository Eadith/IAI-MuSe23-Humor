## Environment

This code is based on Python3.8 and Pytorch 1.12. Other packages in `requirements.txt`.

## Features

For the multimodal features, please refer to [official support](https://www.muse-challenge.org/challenge/data). An extension of the visual features (VTP). Please put the extra features in the same directory as the official features.
The detail feature extractor for VPT referring to [this link](https://github.com/KMnP/vpt), APViT referring to [this link](https://github.com/youqingxiaozhua/APViT).

## Training
This code supports all the network structures and losses. You need to adjust the `config.BASE_PATH` and model save path `config.OUTPUT_PATH` in `config.py` and training parameters in `main.py` file. Then you can first run the `main.py` to train five models with different seeds, and then run the `late_fusion.py` file to fuse the results.
